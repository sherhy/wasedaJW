	"outline": """In this course students will focus on developing advanced essay-writing skills from understanding essay prompts to making better decisions about sentence construction. Emphasis is placed on taking a position in an argumentative essay, researching, evaluating sources, developing cohesive body paragraphs, logically developing ideas throughout the essay, and writing effective introductions and conclusions. Students will also learn essential citation, paraphrasing and summarizing skills, and how to integrate sources into their writing. The ability to write with increasingly greater grammatical complexity and with subtle changes in emphasis and nuance, and closely edit for form and content is also a focus of this course. Students will read academic articles to be further exposed to writing style, vocabulary and background knowledge. 

*Students will be assigned to a class based on their answers to a questionnaire on writing experience together with the results of the TOEFL-ITP test for English placement which is taken before the start of their first semester at SILS.""",
